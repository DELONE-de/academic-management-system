# Start the Backend and Frontend Servers

## Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## Frontend (in a separate terminal)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The backend changes have been made to fix the department loading issue. Once you start the backend server, the signup page should work correctly.
